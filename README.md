# ComPressure

A two channel compressor plugin including mid/side support , gain reduction limits and a safety clipper

The compression algorithm is a (slightly) modified version of Pressure5 from the Airwindows suite, by Chris Johnson (https://www.airwindows.com/pressure5/).
I have kept the parameter names the same as in Pressure5 to make it easier for Airwindows users to use, the little ? icons near each control explain what each does.

This plugin uses the iPlug2 framework, so to build, copy these files to a new subfolder in iPlug2/Examples, and then build from there.

Please feel free to contact me on pelennor@gmail.com with any bugs or feature requests!

Hope you enjoy the plugin!
